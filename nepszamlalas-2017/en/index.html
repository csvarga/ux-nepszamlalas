    		<p>We surveyed the Hungarian UX community to learn more about who we are, what we do, and how we work. We conducted the same research in 2014 so we also wanted to track some changes. The online survey ran between 20 December, 2016 and 19 January, 2017 and was responded by 154 UX professionals.</p>

<h3 id="basics">Basic demography</h3>

<p>Most of our respondents live in Budapest, the Hungarian capital. This should not mean that almost all Hungarian UX professionals live in Budapest, however, this indicates that most our findings are somewhat distorted because of the overrepresentation of people living in the capital.</p>

<p>As a curiosity, the survey was also responded by a few people working outside of Hungary. Their responses might distort averages, too, but it was considered wherever it was relevant.</p>

<p>UX professionals typically have higher education, however, there is 23% who started working right after high school. The bottom line is, you don't necessarily need a degree to work in UX in Hungary, however, studying is always good for your career, of course.</p>

<p>UX people have a really diverse background based on their original field of study. Design, art, IT, and engineering are popular areas, however, if we look at the bigger picture, economics is the most popular background (including marketing, business studies, and so on).</p>

<p>The main takeaway here is that basically anyone can become a UX designer, it's not the background but rather the affinity and determination that matters. Among the repondents we have linguists, lawyers, political scientists, historians and even a cook and a locksmith!</p>

<p>Besides the studies, we were curious to learn what our respondents worked before becoming UX professionals. It comes as no surprise that the most popular previous job is graphic designer, followed by developers and project managers. Interestingly, quality assurance is relatively frequent as well. And when it comes to previous jobs, the complete list is super diverse again: we have former architects, teachers, PR people, writers, journalists, business analysts, HR people, economists, data analysts, researchers, typographers, financiers, and technicians.</p>

<h3 id="self-education">Sources of self-education</h3>

<p>Unsuprisingly, respondents turn to the internet to learn about their profession: online magazines, blogs, and articles were mentioned by most. At the same time, two thirds of the participants claimed to learn from colleagues or friends which means the UX community is really supportive. Many UX professionals also read books and attend meetups to gain new skills.</p>

<p>Note that although not many named local courses as the source of knowledge, the number of such respondents still indicate that we have 33 respondents who became UX practitioners after attending one of the Hungarian UX courses.</p>

<p>As reliable sources of information, participants named a few publication platforms (Medium.com, Behance, social media, and newsletters) and some specific sites as well. Traditional UX magazines are still popular (like <a href="https://alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart</a>, <a href="https://www.uxbooth.com/" target="_blank">UX Booth</a>, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a>, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/" target="_blank">NNGroup articles</a>) accompanied by product blogs (like <a href="https://blog.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InVision</a>, <a href="https://blog.marvelapp.com/" target="_blank">Marvel</a>, or <a href="https://blog.usabilla.com/" target="_blank">Usabilla</a> blog) and recently launched publications (like <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/" target="_blank">UXDesign.cc</a> and <a href="https://uxmovement.com/" target="_blank">UX Movement</a>).</p>

<p>Most of our respondents work as full-time employees, however, many of them have other responsibilities besides UX. Such respondents work as graphic designers, project managers, product designers and developers, however, and are consultants, researchers, and e-commerce professionals as well. It's also not unusual that managers take on UX responsibilities.</p>

<p>Looking at experiences, the UX profession still seems pretty young in our region, with 80% having 6 years of experience or less. Repondents have 4 years of experience on average, and only a few people have been working in the UX area for more than 10 years.</p>

<p>Regarding activities, UX people design interfaces quite frequently, there's only 10% who never does this. Results are pretty similar for designing products and services which means that UX people are now supposed to have a holistic approach rather than just designing screens. A bit disappointing news might be that less than half of the respondents report having done any user research in the last two years. </p>

<p>Diving deeper into user research shows that more than 90% does usability testing from time to time, which sounds amazing (in contrast with the results of the previous question). The second most popular research method is analyzing users' data, followed by user interviewing. Heuristic research and card sorting are only done occasionally, however, almost half of the respondents have done them at least once in the last two years.</p>

<p>We expected a variety of tools and our respondents did not disappoint us as they mentioned dozens of methods, apps, and tools. The most common research platform is Google Analytics, used by half of the respondents. Hotjar got the second place, used by every third UX professional, even though it was only launched two years ago.</p>
<p>We should note that there's no single best tool according to the participants, most respondents use a few research tools together. A typical combination is Google Analytics and Hotjar, used by 25%.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>When it comes to designing, web UI is still the number one responsibility of the UX designers, followed by prototyping. Since 90% claimed that they create prototypes at least occasionally, it's safe to say that the time of static mockups is now over. Mobile app design is really popular, and, surprisingly, way more people design native desktop apps than tablet ones. The "most occasional" design responsibility is copywriting that is done by half of the respondents from time to time.</p>
<p>Accessibility is a niche area for now (60% never works on that), however, in many teams it may not even be considered a UX responsibility. Designing non-digital experiences is a specific area, too, only a few people get to work on that area.</p>

<p>For interface design, Sketch officially became the most popular software, it is now used by more than Photoshop or Axure. Respondents agree again that there's no perfect tool and most of them combine at least two when designing. Actually, Sketch with Photoshop is a popular combo, perhaps because they supplement each other, perhaps because older assets are still maintained in Photoshop. Anyway, let's not write off the Adobe products just yet.</p>

<p>Good old Axure is still the most commonly used tool in this area, however, InVision and Marvel has definitely gained some significant market share recently. </p>
<p>It goes without saying that respondents like combinations in prototyping tools as well but they typically use fewer tools for prototyping than for designing or researching.</p>

<p>Oviously, the more senior position means a higher salary but there are exceptions, too. The average salary of UX managers and directors is for example lower than that of the UX leads. The reason for this might be that UX manager and director respondents typically work for smaller companies which has a negative impact on the average salary of this position.</p>

<p>Interestingly, senior UX designers don't earn more than they did in 2014, probably because they segment grew by 33% and new members of this segment have lower salaries.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb we can say that bigger companies offer higher salaries but companies with 1-10 employes break this pattern. For the small companies we mostly had manager and director respondents, hence the higher average salary there.</p>

<h3 id="satisfaction">Satisfaction</h3>

<p>Based on the results, UX folks don't complain much but there are two areas where the general satisfaction has changed since 2014: respondents are happier with their salaries but less satisfied with their workplaces and work environments. Respondents are not really satisfied with their self-improvement opportunities which is a critical area for them.</p>

<p>Besides salaries, we were also curious to learn about other benefits – what respondents are given and what they appreciate. As it turned out, companies prefer material benefits (bonus, cafeteria plans, etc.) but UX professionals think tranings and courses are the most precious benefits.</p>

<p>Respondents were asked how they'd like to improve and what skills they'd like to acquire (both inside and outside of UX discipline). Although a  typical UX professional apparently wants to learn &quot;everything&quot;, the most popular area seems to be research skills (from user interviewing to big data analysis).</p>

<h3 id="self-fulfillment">Self-fulfillment</h3>

<p>Respondents were asked if there are any responsibilities that they'd like to do more at work (but they don't have the opportunity to do so) and we got more than 40 different answers for that. The most common area was user research (which is aligned with the fact that designers were overrepresented, with assumably less research tasks), followed by a long tail of dozens of options.</p>

<p>Some mentioned specific tasks (e.g. user interviews, usability testing, data mining, graphic design, front-end development, prototyping, UI design, workshop facilitation, etc.), some would like to redesign how they work (e.g. need more focused work, less administration, bigger responsibilities, team work), some wish for specific projects (e.g. machine learning, virtual reality, accessiblity, social responsibility, hardware design, etc.).</p>

<p>"What would make you consider changing jobs?", we asked provovatively. Apparently, it's the opportunity to learn and improve themselves (it's more important than salary) which is perfectly aligned with the other responses about how self-improvement is a cornerstone of this profession.</p>

<h3 id="love-projects">Love projects</h3>

<p>We also asked what a dream project would be for our respondents. Surprisingly, many consider that they already work on dream projects they love – otherwise they'd be working somewhere else.</p>

<p>That being said, the majority was able to mention at least one love project:</p>

<ul>
<li>An important pattern is the meaning of work, that is, working on something meaningful and useful.</li>
<li>Working on a product they truly own is a common desire.</li>
<li>Many would like to work on something with significant social impact. Redesigning government websites and health care services came up frequently, and someone even wants to design State 2.0.</li>
<li>It's a common dream to work on something used by millions, be it a popular product (such as Airbnb or Spotify) or a whole platform like Facebook or Android.</li>
<li>Designing physical products or games (from video games to board games) also comes up in the responses from time to time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Summarising all these patterns makes up the following cornerstones:</p>

<ul>
<li>The majority would like to work on long term product development</li>
<li>where the product is something meaningful</li>
<li>and the project has a huge impact and offers tons of challenge.</li>
<li>This requires a dedicated and ever improving team,</li>
<li>where creativity is embraced</li>
<li>and there's a possibility to experiment with new and exciting technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Someone gave a pretty well designed definition to all of this:</p>

<blockquote><p>If MIT and Gates Foundation jointly were going to save the world with something high-tech, ideally somewhere in South-East Asia or Amazonia – I would like to be the part of the team.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here are the most frequently mentioned industries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automobiles</li>
<li>Industrial interfaces</li>
<li>Space tech</li>
<li>Government and public administration</li>
<li>Games</li>
<li>Internet of Things</li>
<li>Virtual Reality</li>
<li>Airlines</li>
<li>Smart homes</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, another dream project definition that probably resonates with every service designer:</p>

<blockquote><p>Service design that is not just all about the reduction of costs.</p></blockquote>
